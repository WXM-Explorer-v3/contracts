# Minting Operation

The minting operation can be invoked by anyone and its only rate limited by time due to the fact that it can be invoked once daily. 

The daily amount to be minted is hardwired into the smart contract with respect to the [token emissions](./emissions.md).

The target for the daily minted amount is [RewardPool](../src/RewardPool.sol). This is the contract that enables the claiming of rewards for the weather station owners and the company and investors.
